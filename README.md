I’m a self-taught full stack developer, currently expanding my technical depth through Codex Academy.
I blend UX thinking, product strategy, and automation to build practical, user-centered applications.
I design interfaces people want to use, build backends that scale, and turn complex systems into something that just works.

### Notable Work

* Redesigned a DMV kiosk interface to meet accessibility standards and improve usability for public users.
* Built a React app that helps seniors compare insurance plans clearly and confidently.
* Developed a team automation bot that keeps developers on track and projects moving efficiently.

I create tools that are useful, intuitive, and a bit unexpected.
