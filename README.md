I’m a full-stack dev with a UX heart, a product brain, and an AI-assisted workflow.  
I design interfaces people *want to touch*  
Build backend systems that **scale under pressure**  
And debug chaos — code or otherwise.

---

### Whether it’s:
- 🔁 Redesigning a DMV kiosk for accessibility
- 🩺 Helping seniors compare insurance with a clean React UI
- 🤖 Or building a weird little bot for forgetful dev teams...

> I make tools that are useful, intuitive, and just a little unexpected.
